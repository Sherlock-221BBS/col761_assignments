This folder contains the submission for HW1. 

There are three questions in HW1 and the code for each one can be found in the corresponding folders named *q1*, *q2*, and *q3*.

## Q1

In this question, we have been assigned to do empirical comparison of the Apriori between FP-Tree algorithms for frequent itemset mining. The detailed statement can be found [here](./hw1.pdf)

The code for q1 can be found [here](./q1/)

The detailed report of our findings on Question 1 is avaialbe [here](./q1/q1.pdf)


## Q2

In this question, we have been assigend to do empirical comparison of `gSpan`, `FSG` and `Gaston` for frequent subgraph mining. The detailed problem statement can be found [here](./hw1.pdf)

The code for q2 can be found [here](./q2/)

The deatiled report of our finding on Question 2 is available [here](./q2/q2.pdf)


## Q3 
In this question, we have been assigned the task of finding meaningful features useful for graph classification. The constraint of the question is to do feature extraction only using graph based algorithm and to construct only binary feature variable on the basis of presence and absence of selected important features. The detailed problem statement can be found [here](./hw1.pdf)

The code for q3 can be found [here](./q2/)

The detailed report of our findings on Question 3 is available [here](./q3/q3.pdf)
